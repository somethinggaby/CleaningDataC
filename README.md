##Intorduction 
This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization. What follows first are my notes on the original data

##Script 
I created a script called run_analysis.R which will merge the test and training sets together. Prerequisites for this script:
* the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and.
* You must change the working directory to where ever you put the data.
the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity.

##Data
